U can debug the Assertions using ATV (Assertions Thread view) in Questasim.
Add timescale in xbus_tb_top.sv file as follows
`timescale 1ns/1ns

1) Compile the file with +acc option
vlog +acc -f compile_questa_sv.f

2) Simulate xbus_tb_top with -assertdebug option
vsim -assertdebug +OVM_TESTNAME=test_read_modify_write -suppress 3829 xbus_tb_top

3) Add the signals log
add log -r sim:/xbus_tb_top/*

4) Add the require assertions to the Assertion Thread viewer (ATV).
atv log -enable /xbus_tb_top/xi0/*

5) Run the simulation
run -all

6) Now from Top menu open the assertion window as follows.
view -> coverage -> assertions.

7) At the end of window select any concurrent assertion(example: assertAddrUnknown) and right click and select view ATV.
or
Add the required assertion using following command.
add atv /xbus_tb_top/xi0/assertAddrUnknown 135ns

Now u can see the Assertion thread and allows easy debug.

If u find any doubt go to the Questasim help and search for ATV
